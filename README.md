# LogicGates-Simulator
  help - for how to use informations
  
  <p>The LogicGates-Simulator is a CLI built to simulate the comportament of digital integrated circuits</p>
  <p>It is not an advanced tool you can only ad the basic logic gates AND/OR/NOT/XOR/NAND/NOR/XNOR wire them how u like and then provide a set of inputs and the program will give u the output</p>
  <p>Features to be added:</p>
  <ul>
  <li> Abillity to create custome blocks</li>
  <li> A new algorithm for calculating the output so it can support reaction loops</li>
  </ul>
